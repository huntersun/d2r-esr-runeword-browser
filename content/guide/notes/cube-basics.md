In ESR almost every upgrade is a cube recipe. The official Cube Recipes page is the full reference: sections of short rules followed by Input → Output tables. It is not a tutorial, so here is how to read it.

### Reading the page

- "Any …" means any item of that kind. "Torso" is body armor, "Armor" is every kind of armor.
- "ilvl = char level" and similar lines give the output's item level, which decides the affixes it can roll.
- Underlined materials in an output are handed back to you. <!-- verify: meaning of underlined materials on the cube page -->
- Keys, Scrolls of Identify, Antidote Potions and the like often act as switches that pick which variant of a recipe runs.

### Why a recipe does nothing

- **Forging:** most recipes that reroll the input ignore items with a Forging; remove it first ([[forging]]).
- **Level limits:** D-stoning stops once the item's level requirement penalty is too high ([[dstoning-and-mapling]]).
- **Order:** base-upgraded uniques and sets cannot be rerolled, and uniques lose added sockets when rerolled ([[enhancement-order]]).
- **Branded** items cannot be changed by any recipe.
- **Too much in the cube:** keep it under 100 items, or the game may crash ([[avoid-disasters]]).

### Faster cubing

- Since 3.2.11 the transmute hotkey (set it under Options > Controls) works with the cube closed, and holding it repeats.
- Material tabs in the stash upgrade with Shift + click and downgrade with Alt + click, no cube needed.

### Where to start

Socketing ([[socketing]]), Forging ([[forging]]), Dragon Stones ([[dragon-stones]]) and the numbered [[secret-recipes]] cover most of what a new character uses.
